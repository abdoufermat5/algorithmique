# Algorithmique

---

Welcome to my repository, where I delve into the fascinating world of algorithms and coding challenges. This repository serves as a personal archive and a learning resource for anyone interested in algorithmic problem-solving and computer science fundamentals.

## Repository Structure

1. **Coding Sites (`coding_sites`)**: A collection of my solutions to various coding challenges from platforms like LeetCode, CodeSignal, HackerRank, and CodinGame. Each solution is categorized by the site and challenge level, making it easy for you to navigate and compare different approaches to similar problems.

2. **Programming Approach (`programming_approach`)**: Here, you'll find a categorization of algorithms by their approach and type. For example, dynamic programming, divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, and more. This section aims to provide a clear understanding of different algorithmic strategies and their applications.

3. **Coursera Algorithmic Toolbox (`coursera_algorithmic_toolbox`)**: Contains my coursework, notes, and projects from the Coursera course "Algorithmic Toolbox." This section is a great resource for those who are also taking the course or interested in a structured approach to learning algorithms.
