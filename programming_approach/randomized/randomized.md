# real life use cases
## 1. coupon collector
One example of a real-life problem that can be solved using a randomized algorithm is the "coupon collector's problem."
Imagine that you have a collection of n different coupons and you want to know how many coupons you need to collect on
average before you have a complete set. One way to solve this problem is to use a randomized algorithm that simulates
the process of collecting coupons by randomly selecting coupons from a virtual "hat" until all n coupons have been
collected. The algorithm can then compute the average number of coupons that need to be collected over many runs of the
simulation.

## 2. monte carlo simulation
Another example of a real-life problem that can be solved using a randomized algorithm is the "Monte Carlo simulation."
Imagine that you want to estimate the value of pi. One way to solve this problem is to use a randomized algorithm that
simulates the process of throwing darts at a dartboard. The algorithm can then compute the ratio of the number of darts
that land inside the circle to the total number of darts thrown. This ratio is an approximation of the ratio of the areas of
the circle to the square and can be used to compute an estimate for pi.

## 3. knapsack problem
Another example of a real-life problem that can be solved using a randomized algorithm is the "knapsack problem."
Imagine that you are a thief and you want to steal the most valuable items from a store without getting caught. One way
to solve this problem is to use a randomized algorithm that simulates the process of stealing items from the store by
randomly selecting items from the store until you have stolen the most valuable items without getting caught. The
algorithm can then compute the average value of the items that you steal over many runs of the simulation.
